  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>These Terms and Conditions apply to the 69RBbras app (hereinafter referred to as the "Application") for mobile devices, developed by Byte Bear Tecnologia LTDA (hereinafter referred to as the "Service Provider"), and offered as a free service.</p>

  <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these terms. It is strongly recommended that you read them carefully before using the Application. Unauthorized copying or modification of the Application or any part of it, including the Service Provider's trademarks, is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to extract the source code, translate the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions is not permitted. All related trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>

  <p>The Service Provider is committed to making the Application as useful and efficient as possible. Therefore, it reserves the right to modify the Application or charge for its services at any time, for any reason. Any such charges will be clearly communicated to users in advance.</p>

  <p>The Application stores and processes personal data provided by users to deliver the Service. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly discourages jailbreaking or rooting your device, as such actions may compromise your device’s security and could result in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.</p>

  <p>Some features of the Application require an active internet connection, which may be via Wi-Fi or mobile data. The Service Provider is not responsible if the Application does not function properly due to lack of connectivity or if you have exceeded your data limit.</p>

  <p>If you use the Application outside a Wi-Fi area, you should be aware that your mobile provider’s terms still apply. You may be charged for data usage or roaming fees, and by using the Application, you accept responsibility for such charges. If you are not the bill payer for the device, it is assumed you have obtained permission from the person who pays the bill.</p>

  <p>The Service Provider is not responsible for issues resulting from factors outside its control, such as your device running out of battery or not being charged.</p>

  <p>While the Service Provider strives to keep the Application updated and accurate, it depends on third parties for information and services. Therefore, it does not accept liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that results from your reliance on the Application’s features.</p>

  <p>The Application may be updated from time to time. Requirements for the operating system or other systems may change, and you may need to download updates to continue using the Application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that updates will always be made to maintain compatibility with all device versions. By using the Application, you agree to accept updates when offered. The Service Provider may also discontinue the Application at any time without notice. Upon termination, your rights to use the Application will end, and you must uninstall it from your device.</p>

  <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider may update these Terms and Conditions periodically. You are encouraged to review this page regularly for any updates. Any changes will be posted on this page and will take effect immediately upon posting.</p>

  <p>These Terms and Conditions are effective as of 2025-07-25.</p>
